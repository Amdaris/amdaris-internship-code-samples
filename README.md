# Internship Program Code Samples

Welcome to the code samples repository for our internship program! This repository contains code samples for each of the lectures presented during the program. It is designed to be used as a resource for both the presenter and the interns to accompany their presentations and enhance their learning experience.

## How to Use This Repository

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone git@github.com:Amdaris/amdaris-internship-code-samples.git
```

Once you have the repository cloned, you can navigate to each lecture's directory to access the corresponding code samples. Each lecture's directory is organized to follow the same structure as the lectures.


Feel free to explore each lecture's code samples and utilize them to deepen your understanding of the presented concepts. You can open the code samples in your preferred code editor or IDE to examine the code and make modifications as needed.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from interns and presenters to enhance the code samples repository. If you have any improvements or additional code samples to share, please get in touch with one of the presenters.


We appreciate your contributions and collaboration in making this repository a valuable resource for all interns!
